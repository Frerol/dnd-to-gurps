# Dwarf

Dwarves are a stout folk, small in height but really strong. Often they have very large beards, which they braid and tie and adorn, at least when they're not soaking them in beer and ale. They live in underground halls and are very fond of the art of smithing and stonework in general. In some literatures, they have a weak spot for jewelry and precious metals.
In D&D's main setting, Forgotten Realms, there are several dwarven subraces, and I'll try to recreate them as faithfully as possible in GURPS.

## Shield Dwarf
Shield dwarves, also known as mountain dwarves, were among the most common of the dwarven peoples. Once the rulers of mighty kingdoms across Faerûn, the shield dwarves had since fallen by the wayside after centuries of warfare with their goblinoid enemies.

## Gold Dwarf
Gold dwarves, also known as hill dwarves, were the aloof, confident and sometimes proud subrace of dwarves that predominantly came from the Great Rift. They were known to be particularly stalwart warriors and shrewd traders. Gold dwarves were often trained specifically to battle the horrendous aberrations that were known to come from the Underdark.

## Gray Dwarf
Gray dwarves, also known variously as duergar, dark dwarves, underdwarves, or uhubreen – were a subterranean subrace of dwarves. They carved out an existence in the Underdark, often near volcanoes. Their kinship to other dwarven subraces could be compared to that of the drow to surface elves.
