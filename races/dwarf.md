# Dwarf

Dwarves are a stout folk, small in height but really strong. Often they have very large beards, which they braid and tie and adorn, at least when they're not soaking them in beer and ale.
In D&D's main setting, Forgotten Realms, there are several dwarven subraces, and I'll try to recreate them as faithfully as possible in GURPS.
