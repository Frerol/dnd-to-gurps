# Elf
Elves are a gracious and fair folk. They're really fond of nature and therefore usually dwell in forests and wild places, establishing communities that sort of meld with the trees and so on. They live for centuries, and usually are ellusive and avoid interaction with other races.
In D&D's main setting, Forgotten Realms, there are several elven subraces, and I'll try to recreate them as faithfully as possible in GURPS.

## Moon Elf
Moon elves, also known as Teu-tel-quessir in the elven language or as silver elves, were the most common of all the elven subraces. More tolerant of humans than other elves, moon elves were the ancestors of most half-elves. They were considered high elves sometimes also called eladrin. They were also called gray elves, although that was a derogatory term. To be called a "gray" by another elf was a huge insult.
