# Races

Races are one of the first choices one makes when creating a character for a Tabletop RPG adventure. D&D is known to have a particularly rich list of available races, and I'll try my best to convert them into GURPS 4th Edition. My main sources will be the 3.5 Edition's Player's Handbook (PHB), 3rd Edition's Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (FRCS) and 3rd Edition's Races of Faer√ªn (RoF). I might look up additional books, but those three are the most important ones.
